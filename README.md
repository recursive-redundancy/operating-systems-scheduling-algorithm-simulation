A project for Operating Systems course which required developing simulations of 3 different scheduling algorithms, analyzing their performance and writing a report highlighting the performances, differences and benefits of each. My portion of this group project was developing a SJF (Shortest Job First) simulation and the bulk of the essay (excluding the sections detailing the other two algorithm methodologies). Included within is my scheduler code, sample results output, and the overall report.
